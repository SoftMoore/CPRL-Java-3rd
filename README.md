*Compiler Design Using Java&reg;: An Object-Oriented Approach (Third Edition)*
by John I. Moore, Jr.  The book covers implementation of a compiler for CPRL (Compiler PRoject Language),
a programming language designed for teaching the basics of compiler construction.  CPRL includes
variables, statements, expressions, arrays, records, and subprograms.  The target language for the
compiler is assembly language for the CPRL Virtual Machine (CVM), a virtual machine with a stack-based
architecture that is similar to but much simpler than the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
The book is available on
[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Compiler-Design-Using-Java-Object-Oriented/dp/1734139129/)
and, at a discount, directly from the publisher
[IngramSpark](https://shop.ingramspark.com/b/084?B5pnf3RtESoORx2qg3EwQczZvcjthuRtqpsuIAJwQBL).

**The organization of the compiler project into modules has changed from the original printing of the book.
The assembler has been moved into a separate module, so now there are four modules for the compiler project.
See Appendix A listed below for details.**
